Hey, it’s almost Rocky Linux's third birthday! We will celebrate by counting down the next 12 days with games, giveaways, and gatherings to appreciate our community. And YOU are invited to join us.

## About Rocky Linux

The Rocky Linux open source project was founded to ensure long-term community access to a stable, secure Enterprise Linux distribution. This was prompted by the end-of-life announcement of another open source Enterprise Linux project, in the interest of supporting the community that needed a viable alternative. Since its inception in December of 2020, Rocky has been widely adopted and continues to grow and gain momentum.

## Where's the party?

The birthday fun is happening on a special channel of our Mattermost chat server. We will be there today and every day until December 8.
