We are excited to announce that we have added a new merchandise provider for the Rocky Linux project - [HelloTux](https://www.hellotux.com/rocky-linux)! This partnership will expand the options available for our community to show their support for Rocky Linux with high-quality t-shirts, hoodies, polo shirts,[^1] and other swag.

Located in Hungary, HelloTux is positioned to provide great shipping prices for Rocky Linux community members in Europe. They have a long history of working with open source projects and are dedicated to providing top-notch embroidered merchandise, using only free and open source software.[^2]

We are thrilled to be able to offer even more choices for our community to express their pride in Rocky Linux, and especially excited to be able to provide more affordable shipping options for our European community members. And don't worry, [Muckles](https://www.mucklesu.com/collections/rocky-linux) will continue to offer Rocky Linux merchandise, providing inexpensive shipping to the Americas and even more options to choose from.

Shout out to Testing Team Lead Christopher Stackpole ([@stack](mattermost://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/messages/@stack)) for coordinating with HelloTux to make this happen!

Thank you for your continued support of Rocky Linux!
