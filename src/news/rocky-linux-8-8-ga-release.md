We are pleased to announce the general availability of Rocky Linux 8.8. This release is currently available for the x86-64 and aarch64 architectures. Please review the release notes in the [Rocky Linux Documentation](https://docs.rockylinux.org/release_notes/8_8) - These notes contain important information including known bugs and more comprehensive details about changes in this version.

### Breaking Changes

* The Container Universal Base Image `rockylinux/rockylinux:8-ubi` has been changed to be more similar to the RHEL UBI images:
    * Replaced packages: `libcurl` -> `curl-minimal`, `libcurl-minimal`
    * Added packages: `gdb-gdbserver`, `gzip`
    * Removed packages: `binutils`, `brotli`, `dmidecode`
    * network config cleanup added
* Microsoft Azure images are now published in the Shared Galleries. This provides a direct way to consume Rocky Linux images without subscribing to the image via the marketplace.
* LVM cloud image variants now remove `/etc/lvm/devices/system.devices` to resolve issues with PV/VG/LVs upon installation of the images due to being hardcoded to a specific device.

## Highlights

### Notable New Features and Changes

* Intel Arc GPU support has been added.
* Git has been updated to 2.39.1, enabling support of commit signing with SSH keys
* FIPS mode settings in the kernel have been adjusted to conform to the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3.
* Podman's [Quadlet](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/quadlet-podman) feature is now available.

A more complete list of new features and changes is available in the [Rocky Linux 8.8 Release Notes](https://docs.rockylinux.org/release_notes/8_8)
