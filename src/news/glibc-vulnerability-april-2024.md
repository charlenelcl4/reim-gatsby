Last week, [CVE-2024-2961](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2961) was announced. In brief, systems using glibc and serving php content
could potentially be at risk. The vulnerability is related to the ISO-2022-CN-EXT character set. 

While at the time of writing this article there is no glibc package with the fix, a small workaround to disable the compromised character set is advised.


First, let us check if the system has the compromised set, running ``` iconv -l | grep -E 'CN-?EXT'```

If there is no output, the system is safe to this vulnerability. If the output is similar to the one below, the system is vulnerable. Read below 
for the steps to fix it.

```
[lexi@emerald gconv]$ iconv -l | grep -E 'CN-?EXT'
ISO-2022-CN-EXT//
ISO2022CNEXT//
```

Browse to ```/usr/lib64/gconv/gconv-modules.d```

Edit ```gconv-modules-extra.conf```

Go to line 1254 and comment out the following:

```
 alias ISO2022CNEXT//          ISO-2022-CN-EXT//
 module        ISO-2022-CN-EXT//       INTERNAL                ISO-2022-CN-EXT 1
 module        INTERNAL                ISO-2022-CN-EXT//       ISO-2022-CN-EXT 1
```

do ```sudo iconvconfig``` to regenerate the cache. 

now, running ```iconv -l | grep -E 'CN-?EXT'``` should return no output.
