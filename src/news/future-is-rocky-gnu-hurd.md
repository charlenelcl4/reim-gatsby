The future of the Rocky Linux Project is Rocky GNU/Hurd, and over the next year weâ€™ll be shifting focus from Rocky Linux, the rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), to Rocky GNU/Hurd, which tracks just ahead of stability. Rocky Linux 8, as a rebuild of RHEL 8, will end at the end of 2029. Rocky GNU/Hurd continues after that date, serving as a silly April Fool's Day joke.

We have [an FAQ](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) to help with your information and planning needs, as you figure out how this shift of project focus might affect you.
